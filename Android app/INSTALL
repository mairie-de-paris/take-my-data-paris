This guide will explain how to install and configure the TMD application

1) Define the google map api-key
   edit the file res/layout/map.xml and replace "xxx" with your api-key in the line :
   	android:apiKey="xxx"
 
2) Set the server requests
   edit the file src/com/utils/MyAsyncTask and replace "xxx" with your own server url in the line :
   private static final String SERVER_URL = "xxx";

3) The application needs the SherlockActionBar project to compile.
   Download it here http://actionbarsherlock.com and include it as a library in the TMD project

4) Define the original luncher background
   edit the file src/com/ui/Luncher.java and replace "xxx" with your own image url in the line :
   public static final String IMG_URL = "url";
   
5) Using Bugsense for tracking errors (http://www.bugsense.com)
   edit the file src/com/ui/Home.java and replace "xxx" with your own BugSense id in the line :
   BugSenseHandler.initAndStartSession(this, "xxx");
